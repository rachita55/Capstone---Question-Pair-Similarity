# Capstone Project-Question-Pair-Similarity
-> This app aims at finding similar questions on a community forum using complex NLP &amp; Deep Learning techniques 


Hundreds and thousands of people post their queries/questions in platforms like stack-overflow and quora.

These questions are pushed to the experts in the community, who answer them.

However, many such questions may already be answered and all these answers are found useful by users. 

To avoid the problem of redundancy and duplicity of answers, we, at Praxis Business School, Bangalore have started our #Capstone project with the objective to design a system that will be able to identify similar questions using state-of-the-art #NLP techniques and fetch answers from such similar questions, hence improving user experience.
